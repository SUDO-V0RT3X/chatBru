# chatBru

chatBru is an AI chatbot which responds using South African slang. It is built via Gemini's API.

## Applications

A simple CLI is available at the moment, with a Python GUI and web app coming soon.
Stay tuned for that!

Note: The .gitignore file shows a .env file which is not pushed to GitHub. When using this program, ensure that you generate an API key from Gemini (visit [here](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) to generate an API key after logging into your Google account), and create a file called .env and add the following line to said file:

`GEMINI_API_KEY=*your API key*`

Also, be sure to install the necessary Python packages before running.
Run using `python3 test.py` for Linux/MacOS or `python test.py` for Windows.
